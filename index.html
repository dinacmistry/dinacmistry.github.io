  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
  I am a network scientist currently working in the Epidemiology team at the <a href="https://idmod.org/">Institute for Disease Modeling</a>, a part of the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Institute-for-Disease-Modeling">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.

  I like studying people  and why we do what we do. In particular, I have spent a lot time thinking about how people interact in the physical world and how we can measure and model those interactions.
  My research has focused on characterizing and modeling the heterogeneity of social contact networks and mobility networks that are linked to the spread of infectious diseases and how this changes our understanding of disease dynamics. 

  </p>

  <p>

  My research interests also include behavioural response to disease. Why do some diseases scare us, while others barely elicit a reaction? 
  <!-- My hypothesis is that  -->
  I think
  our responses are driven 
  <!-- there are -->
  by many factors 
  <!-- to this -->
  beyond rational logic. Fear, risk perception, individual and collective memory, social pressure, cost, and access to or lack of resources, all serve in the mental calculations behind our behavior.


  During my current postdoctoral position I've been working on aspects of this by modeling human response to disease awareness as a result of social trust and collective memory in social networks, and showing how under the right conditions lessons learned from past epidemics can prevent future outbreaks.

  <p>
    During the current COVID-19 pandemic I have been working 
    <!-- as a part of multiple research teams at IDM -->
    with
     the rest of the IDM Research team and leading the social contact network modeling
     <!-- multiple  -->
     to help inform local and global policies to control and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We are using a combination of compartmental and agent based model of infectious disease to models how proposed strategies might work in the real world and their tradeoffs. You can take a look at our various work on the <a href="https://covid.idmod.org/#/ResearchandReports">IDM Infohub</a>.

    <!-- Over the last few years I've been building my philosophy towards research and science. Experience has taught me that there are many ways to answer research questions. My philosophy is to take a fundamentally data-driven approach when it comes to questions about human behavior. Not only can data help to anchor your research questions, but it can also help with interpretation. -->


    <!-- Dina Mistry is a Post Doctoral Research Scientist in the Epidemiology team at IDM. Dina has a Ph.D. in Physics and M.Sc. in Physics from Northeastern University. Dina also holds an Hon. B.Sc. in Astronomy, Physics, and Mathematics from the University of Toronto, Canada. Her doctoral research aimed at characterizing and modeling the social contact networks and mobility networks involved in the spread of airborne infectious diseases. Her research at IDM builds on this expertise by focusing on modeling human response to disease awareness and the impact this has on disease spreading using interdisciplinary approaches from Physics, Network Science, and Cognitive Psychology. Her interests include using digital signals of health information and communication (such as Google, Twitter, Reddit) to model disease awareness and response, as well as developing more general methods of network comparison and measurement. -->

    <!-- I love studying data and people. -->
    <!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of Causal Inference, Machine Learning, and Social Network Analysis. -->
    <!-- I am passionate about (i) drawing insights from data, (ii) designing interventions, and (iii) running randomized experiments. -->
    <!-- I spent the summer of 2019 at <a href="https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science/">Facebook's Core Data Science</a> team studying users who bring people together. -->

  Before joining IDM, I was a member of the MOBS Lab in the <a href="https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/">Network Science Institute</a> at Northeastern University and earned my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/people/alessandro-vespignani">Professor Alessandro Vespignani</a>, Director of the Network Science Institute and Sternberg Family Distinguished Professor. I also received my M.Sc. in Physics from Northeastern University and hold an Hon. Specialist degree with High Distinction in Astronomy & Physics, minor in Mathematics from the University of Toronto, Canada.

<!-- ========== LEADERSHIP & SERVICE ========== -->
<div class="docs-section" id="service">
  <h4>Leadership & Service</h4>

  <p>I am involved with a number of initiatives within the network science research commmunity. I am currently Chair of the Society of Young Network Scientists (SYNS) and in 2019 I helped to found Diversify NetSci, a satellite at the flagship Network Science Conference aimed at building a more diverse and inclusive research community. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Diversity, equity, and inclusion are important to me both as a woman of color and a first generation scientist. I have spent much of my higher education and research years as either the only woman in the room or the only person of color in the room (often times both). Learning and spending time in these environments has been lonely at times and often frustrating, though I am grateful for the wonderful friends and colleagues I have met along the way. I am also part of the first generation in my family to attend university or college. Growing up working class and the child of immigrants has colored the ways in which I view and experience the world. It has meant at times a dearth of opportunities, access, and guidance. With my work on diversity initiatives I am trying to highlight inequities and identify some of the best strategies out there for recruiting and retaining a more diverse science community. I believe we can do better and I am committed to helping build up other young scientists so that they can have more opportunities and success than the generation before them.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a href="https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/diversifynetsci2020">Diversify NetSci</a> is currently in it's 2nd year as a satellite, going live (virtually) on Friday September 18th and Saturday September 19th. Come join us and <a href="dina.c.mistry@gmail.com">get in contact</a> if you want to get involved with this initiative going forward.

<!-- ========== PERFORMANCES ========== -->
<div class="docs-section" id="performances">
  <h4>Personal</h4>

  <p>
  I have been playing the steel pan (native to the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago) since the age of 10, and performing publicly since the age of 14. From 14 through 18, I was a member of 3 performance bands, including 2 steel pan bands and a Jazz/Motown Ensemble. Most recently, I have joined the <a href="https://www.seattlesteelpanproject.com/">Seattle Steel Pan Project</a>. My main instruments are the Double Tenor and Tenor Pans, though I am also known to play the Double Seconds, 6 Bass, Treble Bass, and Cello Pans. In the summer, we perform at festivals and concerts throughout Seattle and the surrounding areas. If you're a Pacific North West local, you may recognize some of these events.
